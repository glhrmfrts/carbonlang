// There are two classes of error handling in Gamma:

//  - Errors => Considered a regular value (error or T),
//  this is meant to be used as the general-purpose error handling mechanism
//  for Gamma user-space programming (e.g. Applications, Libraries, etc...)

//  - Exceptions => Reserved for the Gamma runtime to signal rare but possible runtime conditions,
//  like out of bounds array access, bad variant access, out of memory and such.
//  Unlike most other programming languages though, exceptions in Gamma are not meant to be used as
//  a general control-flow mechanism, so exceptions are meant to be handled locally in the same function.
//  If not handled in the current function, an exception will crash the program with a message written to stderr.
